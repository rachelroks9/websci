Lab 1: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap and JSON


When I first got the lab the first thing I did was learn about Bootstrap. While I have heard of Bootstrap, I did not know exactly how it worked. It was very interesting to see how it worked and once I got the hang of it, it became a very powerful tool. 

I then imported the JSON via a GET call. I set a variable URL so that you can easily change what JSON file you are importing data from. Pulling and splitting the data from the JSON file was very easy. When I put in the profile pictures I realized that there were a lot of broken images so I did some research and learned how to replace broken images with a default picture. 

What I found to be extremely challenging was handling the hashtags. Initially my check to see if the array was empty was not working. Once I finally figured that out, the rest of the lab went pretty smoothly. 

I found this lab to be very interesting. While it wasnâ€™t too challenging, it required me to touch up on some topics and learn more about different things. I really enjoyed using Bootstrap and plan to use it in the future for my other projects.
