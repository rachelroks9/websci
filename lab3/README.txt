Lab 3: GIT & Bug Tracking

Objective One:
- Setup Hosted Account: I previously had a GitHub account that I am using. 
- Setup Local and Remote Repo for Coursework: A GitHub private repo has been set up and shared with Professor Plotka and Wissal. The link is https://github.com/rachelroks9/websci. Because I already had a local repo for my WebSci work it was a bit challenging doing the initial sync between my remote and local repo, but I followed the instructions and used the command line to set it up. You can see a screenshot of my local repo under “local repo.png”.

Objective Two:
- Setup Server for Project: We decided to host our project on Heroku. The link for our project is http://takemehometonight.herokuapp.com. Currently it has been deployed and is functioning correctly. Because we have nothing in our project folder, the app gives an application error. You can see a screenshot of the app in my folder under “Heroku App.png”
- Setup Local and Remote Repo: A GitHub public repo has been set up. The link is https://github.com/David-Sparky/TakeMeHomeTonight. Because it is a public repo, Professor Plotka and Wissal should be able to access it without it being explicitly shared with. I used the GitHub Desktop Client to setup our project as a local repo. 
- Setup a Bug Tracking Server: I set up a bug tracking with Mantis. Originally I had issues logging into the bug tracker when it was installed, but then I deleted the database and reinstalled and it worked. You can see a screenshot of the completed install under “Mantis Install Complete.png”, a screenshot of where I can add a project under “Mantis Add Project.png” and a screenshot of all of the bugs under “Mantis All Bugs.png”.
